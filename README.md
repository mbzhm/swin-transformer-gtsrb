This project explores performance of fine-tuned hierarchical vision transformer - SWIN (https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.14030) - for traffic sign classification on the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign). The fine-tuned pretrained model has achieved 96.63% accuracy on the test dataset.
